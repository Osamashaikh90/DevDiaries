### Causes behind the Error‚ö†Ô∏è
Before we dive into the solutions, let's first understand why the "**nodemon.ps1 cannot be loaded**" error occurs in the first place. _By default, Windows PowerShell has a restricted execution policy, which means that it will only run scripts that are signed by a trusted publisher._ This helps to prevent malicious scripts from being executed on your system.

### 2 ways to fix the error areüõ†Ô∏è

1. Unrestricting the <u>Execution-Policy</u>.
2. Deleting the <u>nodemon.ps1</u> from local device.

### 1. Unrestricting the Execution-Policy.
#### Step 1:
open Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
#### Step 2:
Run the following command in the PowerShell.

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

It will give you "**Restricted**" or "**AllSigned**" or "**RemoteSigned**". So, this is the main reason behind the error as running scripts on the system is '**Restricted**'.
#### Step 3:
Use this command to make it Unrestricted -

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

After executing the command, you will get to see a prompt asking for allowance to change the execution policy.
**Press Y** to change the execution policy.
The **problem** is **solved**. Now you can use **nodemon** on your machine.

> **Disclaimer:** Note that running scripts with an unrestricted execution policy can be a security risk. If you are not sure whether or not a script is safe to run, you should not run it.
**This way is not much advisable as  Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the**

### 2. Deleting the nodemon.ps1 from local device.

*So we have another solution which is very easy and safeüòç*

#### Step 1:
Open your File Explorer and enter the path in the File path section

```
C:\Users\(Your username)\AppData\Roaming\npm
```
